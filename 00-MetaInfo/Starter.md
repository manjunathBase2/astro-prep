##### Pointers
- Create \_root-index.md for all folder  (has navigation links and description)
- Each topic folder has Arrays.md separate page for cumulative notes on that topic
- Make meaning connections like a common pattern to the Topic (Array) page and sub-patterns to the main pattern page
- Feel free to add a pattern page alone too `Two-Sum.md` 
- Use Templating extensively 
- `Assets` folder to maintain images, pdfs or any other embeds
- Push the daily vault to git on a daily basis
- GRIND to be KISS
	- notes on `astro` vault
	- spaced repetition on `anki`
